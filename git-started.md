How to submit your changes
==========================
(Dislaimer, this is not git best practices, this is the easiest way I could think so it wouldn't get in the way)

You should create a folder with a number and your name, and make your game inside of it. The biggest risk you take with git is if you ever edit anything outside of your personal folder, if you never do that, your experience will be as smooth as it gets.

Once you are happy with your changes, you can use the checkboxes to mark what you want to be sent to the project by checking the boxes (again, make sure you know what you are doing if you edit anything outisde your personal folder). 

Write a title to name your change in the summary box, and if you want you can add a description. Then press commit to **main**.

Ta-da! All your checked files should've disappeared from the left panel, which means they are part of your *local version* of the project now. 

Now, to sync your things, you just need to press `Pull Origin` (to get changes from everyone else) and then you should be able to `Push Origin` (to send your changes to everyone else). You can go to the github page again to see if your changes are there, here are mine:
