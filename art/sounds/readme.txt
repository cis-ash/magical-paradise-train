hi guys
i don't know where to put these so i'm just gonna make a new folder
feel free to... move it to a more suitable location?
anyway, these are a couple of loops free for yall to use in ur games if u want
if u want something with a specific tone hit me up and ill see what i can do

- q

ps . to other music makers: i think the game would flow nice if we made everything in the same bpm. this is all midi so i can reexport things; lets negotiate the common bpm. for now i chose 100 cuz its the chillest tempo
