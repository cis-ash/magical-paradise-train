WARNING:

Editing the '.png' files in here is dangerous, as they are likely to be overridden.

(The .png files here are exported outputs from existing pyxeledit projects.

Please copy them out of here and into a different folder or into your own project!

OR, if you have pyxeledit, the source .pyxel files are in this folder; if you edit
them and export the tileset, there will be no danger of overwriting.
